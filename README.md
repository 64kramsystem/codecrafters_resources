# CodeCrafters Resources

Resources for my CodeCrafters writings.

The rendered diagrams have been generated via [PlantText](https://www.planttext.com).

## SQLite diagrams

Page diagrams can be found in the [sqlite](./sqlite) directory, with the source, and SVG/PNG renderings.

The fields described are a subset of the full specification - they're only those required to solve the problems of the CodeCrafters challenge; some concepts are therefore skipped, e.g. overflow.

The green background color indicates fields that are shared across different page types; if fields of a child are highlighted, but not the parent, it means that the child itself is optional, but when present, its highlighted fields are mandatory.
