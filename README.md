# CodeCrafters Resources

Resources for my CodeCrafters writings.

The rendered diagrams have been generated via [PlantText](https://www.planttext.com).

## SQLite resources

Page diagrams can be found in the [sqlite](./sqlite) directory, with the source, and SVG/PNG renderings.

The fields described are a subset of the full specification - they're the ones required to solve the problems of the CodeCrafters challenge. Some concepts are therefore skipped, e.g. overflow.

The green background color indicates fields that are shared across different page types; if a child is highlighted, but not the parent, it means that the child is optional, but when present, the highlighted fields are mandatory.

The directory also contains a [snapshot](./sqlite/fileformat.html) of the official database file format [page](https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html)
